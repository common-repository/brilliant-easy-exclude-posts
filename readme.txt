Hide posts from public view so users need the direct link (but not a password) to view the hidden posts. Activate this feature with a simple checkbox on the editor screen.

== Description ==
So, you want to hide one or more of your WordPress posts, so that only people who have the direct link can find them?

Unfortunately, the "Private" option for post visibility makes posts visible only to people who are logged in to the site. But the "Publish" option makes a post visible to the entire world. Brilliant Easy Exclude Posts (BEEP) creates a middle ground by allowing you to make a post hidden.

A hidden post, once published, will be available to anyone with the link, but it will be removed from site feeds.

To make a post hidden, select the check box in the "Exclude this post?" box on the post editor page, and update / publish the post.

There are two settings you can change. Visit your Reading settings page to adjust these settings. First, by default, the post pages will be excluded on every page on your site (except places where the link is hard-coded), but you can adjust the settings to allow hidden posts to display links to other hidden posts in sidebars, such as a recent posts widget. The second option allows you to allow search engines to index hidden pages, whereas by default they are hidden.

== Installation ==
Upload the brilliant_easy_exclude_posts folder to your site\'s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Activate the plugin through your WordPress administration plugins page.
